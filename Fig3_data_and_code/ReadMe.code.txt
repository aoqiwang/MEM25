A machine learning analysis was conducted on a gene family presence-absence matrix across the 46 species to discern crucial genetic traits that differentiate freshwater and marine algae. Each species was represented in binary form, with “1” denoting the presence of a gene family and "0" indicating its absence. Our method involved a two-stage machine learning approach encompassing 86 models and model combinations, including Random Forest, Lasso, glmboost, Ridge, SVM, KNN, NaiveBayes, GBM, DecisionTree, and Enet (with various alpha values). Initially, models performed feature selection to pinpoint potential gene families, followed by additional filtering or classification to enhance classification accuracy. A 5-fold cross-validation method was employed across all models to ensure robust performance evaluation. For models like Ridge Regression without inherent feature constraints, accuracy was incrementally tested with feature sets in batches of 50 genes to determine the optimal feature count for peak performance. This meticulous approach ensured that each model combination achieved its highest classification accuracy, enabling precise identification of genetic traits crucial for distinguishing between freshwater and marine species. The most effective model combination, Random Forest + Elastic Net [0.6], boasting a classification accuracy of 97%, was utilized to highlight featured genes.
surSigExp-all.txt contains the gene distribution of each gene family under each species. The model_result.txt file details the precision of each model and the families of characteristic genes.
And the PCA graph was drawn based on the characteristic gene families.
