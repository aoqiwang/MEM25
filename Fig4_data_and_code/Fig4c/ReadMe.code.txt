Here, we provide the complete gene expression matrices of MEM25 and FACHB-9 after gene family merging, which are stored in log2_gene_expression.txt. 
Phenotype.txt is the phenotypic setting file in the WGCNA analysis. 
The complete and reproducible code Code.r supports running in R. 
And set the soft threshold to 7. See power_WGCNA.pdf.
The Results.txt file records the cluster affiliation of each gene as analyzed by WGCNA.
