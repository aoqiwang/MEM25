Fig. 7. Functional validation of newly discovered salinity-related genes. (a) Transcript-metabolite correlations. A total of 1,231 orthologous gene families and 109 metabolites exhibiting significant correlations with changes in salinity (correlation coefficient > 0.9) are included. Metabolites and orthogroups are represented by red dots and blue dots, respectively. (b) Biomass production of N. oceanica mutants. (c) Cell density of N. oceanica mutants. The N. oceanica equivalents of CP4g4492, CP1g58, CP5g5156, CP8g6201, CP11g8082, and CP10g8454 are No7.g304, No80.g2678, No267.g7535, No185.g5882, No295.g8628, and No66.g2227, respectively. (d) Root length in the knockout mutant of the Arabidopsis homologs (AT3G42860 and AT5G63540) under a 150 mM salt concentration. Two independent knockout plant lines were examined for AT5G63540 (i.e., 666720 and 673674). Data are presented as the means ± SD (n = 3 for b, c; n = 13 for d). Asterisks (*) indicate statistically significant differences (P ≤ 0.05) with two-sided test.
