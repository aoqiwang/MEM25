Transcript-metabolite correlations. A total of 1,231 orthologous gene families and 109 metabolites exhibiting significant correlations with changes in salinity (correlation coefficient > 0.9) are included. Metabolites and orthogroups are represented by red dots and blue dots, respectively.
18_Correlation_between_gene_expression_and_metabolites.xlsx containing Pearson correlation analysis results between key gene families and key metabolites. The functional annotation details and one-on-one associations of all metabolites and genes, as well as expression levels or metabolic abundance values, are also included.
