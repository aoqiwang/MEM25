A mutant pool for MEM25 was generated by EMS mutagenesis following our previous report. In brief, the mutagenesis conditions were optimized by treating log-phase cells with different concentrations of EMS for varying durations, followed by assessing the number and morphology of the resulting colonies. A mutant pool was constructed using the optimized conditions and candidate mutants were further assessed for growth in either the low salinity (i.e., 35‰) or the high salinity (i.e., 70‰) conditions. The turbidity was monitored by recording OD750 at indicated intervals. A total of 536 mutants with altered OD750 were selected for further phenotyping under the high-salinity conditions. The 365 mutants with stable phenotypes after ten generations were assessed further for growth in the high salinity conditions (i.e., 70‰). Dry weight, cell size, and cell number were recorded. Finally, genomes of 195 salinity-related mutants and three WT samples were resequenced using the second-generation sequencing Illumina platform for PE150 sequencing (Novogene Company, China). 
GWAS_phenotype.txt contains detailed physiological measurement phenotypes for each mutant and wild-type. Including cell density, cell size, and dry weight.
