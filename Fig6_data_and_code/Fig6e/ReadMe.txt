Mapping of topologically associating domains (TADs) and loops on chromosome 4. TADs are highlighted with yellow lines, while loops are depicted by blue lines. The interaction between S04_3657761 and gene CP4g4237 is illustrated by red arrows.
The Hi-C interaction frequency matrix was analyzed by Homer, FitHic (version 2.0.8), HiCExplorer (version 3.7.2), and HiCCUPS (version 5.14).
Here, we provide a Hi-C annotation track called hic_annotations.bedpe, which runs using Juicebox software combined with MEM25.hic frequency matrix for visualizing chromatin TAD and Loop.
