Rooted phylogenetic tree featured 38 Chlorophyta species and representative species from cyanobacteria, Rhodophyta, Glaucophyta, streptophyte algae, and embryophytes. 
The species tree was deduced using the most closely related genes within single-copy or multi-copy orthogroups (n=199), based on the Species Tree from All Genes (STAG) algorithm.

Here we provide the specific amino acid sequences in 199 gene families of all 46 species. 
And the final time evolutionary tree calculated based on the r8s software.
