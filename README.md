# Abstract
Deciphering habitat shifts across salinity boundary, necessitates discovery of the “lost” and “acquired” saline genes. By assembling a telomere-to-telomere genome, we propose that the euryhaline Chlorophyta Chlorella sp. MEM25 represents an early-diverging saltwater species that has evolved numerous genes essential for saltwater-freshwater transitions. Genome comparison to those of Viridiplantae identified green-plant-heritage genes and evolutionary novelties related to salinity adaptation. Saline-related features may arise through genes expansion, horizontal gene transfer, and multi-levels choreography. Loss-of-function mutants of the proposed salt-sensitive genes in algae and plants exhibited increased salt resistance, highlighting the potential of the MEM25 genome as breeding resources. Notably, the gene RMI1 plays important roles in salinity tolerance across species, from microalgae to higher plants. This resource will enhance a wide range of studies, from exploring the evolutionary history of saltwater-freshwater shifts to uncovering the mechanisms of osmoregulation, which can be utilized for crop breeding.

# GWAS analysis of MEM25
This document outlines a comprehensive ​​GWAS (Genome-Wide Association Study) analysis pipeline​​ for the MEM25​​, focusing on variant detection, quality control, and association testing with phenotypic traits. The workflow begins with raw sequencing data preprocessing (e.g., Fastp filtering, BWA alignment, GATK-based variant calling) and emphasizes rigorous quality checks, including duplicate removal, base quality recalibration (BQSR) skipping (due to MEM25’s non-model status), and hard filtering of SNPs/INDELs based on metrics like QD, FS, and MQ. Key steps include GVCF generation, joint genotyping, population-level PCA to assess stratification (minimal in MEM25 mutants), and phenotype normalization to mitigate batch effects. The final GWAS employs PLINK for linear regression, using kinship matrices and PCA covariates to link genetic variants (MAF ≥ 0.05) to growth-related traits (dry weight, cell size). The pipeline highlights MEM25’s industrial potential while addressing challenges like low heterozygosity (0.00743) and sequencing depth trade-offs (e.g., ~35X to 25X post-Q30 filtering). Results are validated through statistical thresholds and visualizations (e.g., PCA plots, density distributions), ensuring robust variant-phenotype associations.
